# Frontend Applications

This repo will be my journey of creating an application with a JavaScript front-end framework that dynamically renders data to the view of the user.

The goal of this course would be as following;
> create a client-side application in JavaScript which dynamically renders data to views using either a front-end framework or system created by you. Reflect on the merits and costs of frameworks together.

This course is specifically given by the Hogeschool van Amsterdam CMD. More information about the course specifically can be found at [CMDA-TT's github](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-21-22).



## Features

- Working with a framework or system
